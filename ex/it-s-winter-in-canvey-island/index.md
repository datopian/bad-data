It's winter in Canvey Island!

The [UK Electoral Commission](http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/) publishes as open data all reference electoral data after any election or referendum. The data covers a range of areas including electorates, turnout, rejected ballot papers and postal voting figures. 

This is great and the data is extremely valuable to gather insight on the political profile and engagement of British people... if only the data was reliable. Clearly, for example, the 2012 council elections data went through too much manual processing, and the name of places like the ward of Canvey Island West in Castle Point, east of England, can get distorted into "Canvey Island *Winter*" :-(

It doesn't have to be that way. The Office for National Statistics publishes very well-structured [lookup tables](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/geoportal/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B6E4A886F-45B4-4770-94FB-ABFA4EEE8F51%7D) that associate unique codes to the wards and enable lookup vs higher level administrative entities such as the Local Authorities the ward belongs to. 

If this wasn't enough, [all the Census 2011 open data](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011) can be distilled in files ordered by ward codes, hence could be unequivocally associated to the electoral data... if only the Electoral Commission used the ONS codes. Why don't they, then? Nobody knows... :-(
