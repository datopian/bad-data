This dataset of long-term employment provides a wonderful example of an "ASCII Spreadsheet" including what "merge cells" looks like in plain text (see the Employed heading).

It also is a good example of a data structure (as opposed to format) which is "human readable" but not [machine readable][mr].

You can find a cleaned version of the data at <https://github.com/datasets/employment-us> and the clean up script is at <https://github.com/datasets/employment-us/blob/master/scripts/process.py>
