title: Adding a Bad Data Example
---

New examples are wanted! Here's how to submit one.

## What information to provide

What's we'd like to see in a good example is:

* Original data url (and name of organization providing the data)
* File format (e.g. CSV, Shapefile etc)
* A description of what's wrong
* A nice illustrative image or screenshot

Optional (but desirable): a backup of the data in case it goes away! (If the file is more than ~100kb please provide a chopped down version illustrating the main "badness").

Also don't forget to credit yourself in an appropriate way (if you want to be credited!).
